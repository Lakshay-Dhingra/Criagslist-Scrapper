        <h2>About Craigslist Web Scrapper</h2>
        <dl>
            <div>
            <dt>Q. Is this website free to use?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, this website is completely free to use. It is a college project which scrapes data from <a href="https://delhi.craigslist.org/">craigslist.org</a> and displays it on this website.</dd>
            </div>

            <div>
            <dt>Q. How it actually works?</dt>
            <dd>First a user selects the desired city. Then the website makes request to region.craigslist.org with the desired search. For example if Delhi is selected, we will make request to <a href="https://delhi.craigslist.org/">delhi.craigslist.org</a> with the search request and then scrap the important data to present to the user.</dd>
            </div>

            <div>
            <dt>Q. Why use this website if actual website is already there?</dt>
            <dd>It's your choice, this website is also not for profit. This one uses the original website at its backend and when you open an advertisement, you will be eventually redirected to the original website. It provides a better UI at the cost of a very slight increase in response time.</dd>
            </div>

            <div>
                <dt>Q. What data do we store?</dt>
                <dd>We don't store any personal data related to the user, not even IP Address. We just store what searches were made from which city, thats it. We do scrape some limited data from <a href="https://delhi.craigslist.org/">craigslist.org</a> but we don't even store that data, because storing data by scrapping craigslist is kind of, illegal.</dd>
